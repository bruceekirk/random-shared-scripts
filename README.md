sharing random scripts

i will try to intermittently update this repo with scripts i have written (sometimes with help from chatGPT) that may be of use to others.

ticker_bw.py : user inputs font and destination folder, as well as a start value, interval, and number of iterates. script saves to the destination folder png files of the corresponding number series, for use as an image sequence to label timeseries images/data (especially useful in Premiere Pro)
